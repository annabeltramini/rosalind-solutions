# rosalind-solutions
This repository contains all the Rosalind programming exercises I have solved,as well as the first solution I have found and new techniques I learned from it

### 1. Counting DNA Nucleotides
**My solution**
``` python
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
**Alternatives**
``` python
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

### 2. Transcribing DNA into RNA

### 3. Complementing a strand of DNA
